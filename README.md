# pandas challenge - PyCitySchools

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you've become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Report

1. School type could be a factor that influence students' scores, both math, reading, and overall performance. From the Scores by School Type table, we could see that students from Charter schools outperform on all five variables (Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, Overall Passing Rate) than students from District schools.

2. School size could be another factor that influence students' academic performance. From the Scores by School Size table, we could see that large size schools (2000-5000) have a lower overall passing rate (58.29%) comparing with small size schools (89.88%) and medium size schools (90.62%).
